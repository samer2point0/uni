    "In natural language processing, working with XML is something that you have to do very regularly. Luckily, Python provides very powerful tools for processing and manipulating documents. In this exercise we look at the `xml.etree.ElementTree` module. as with many of the previous exercises, we will only look at a subset of the features available. Please read the [full documentation](https://docs.python.org/2/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html) for deeper understanding.\n",
