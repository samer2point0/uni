Hello, This is a brief guide to the python file attached
The code is written and compiled in pyhton3

1- Libraries:
    pickle, gensim, NLTK, numpy, scipy, scikit-learn, re

2- Resources:
    sentiment lexicons from uci (negative_words.txt & positive_words.txt)
    glove 50 dimensions w2vec file (glove.twitter.27B.50d.txt)
    pickled decision tree classifier (cosSimDT.txt)
    pickled hierarchical classifier (hierarchicalDT.txt)

3- instructions:
  * First make sure you install the libraries mentioned in 1
  * Secondly make sure that all the resources above are in the same directory and have the same name above.
  * Thirdly insure that the training set and the test sets are also in the same directory.
  * Finally RUN!!

5- Notes:
  * The code take about 10 minutes to run
  * Some areas of the code are commented out and these are left there mainly to show how the pickled objects
    were generated.

Thanks!
