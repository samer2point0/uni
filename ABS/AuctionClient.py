        '''You have all the variables and lists you could need in the arguments of the function,
        these will always be updated and relevant, so all you have to do is use them.

        and may the games begin!'''

        '''
        numberbidders is an integer displaying the amount of people playing the auction game.

        wincondition is an integer. A postiive integer means that whoever gets that amount of a single type
        of item wins, whilst 0 means each itemtype will have a value and the winner will be whoever accumulates the
        highest total value before all items are auctioned or everyone runs out of funds.

        artists will be a dict of the different item types as keys with the total number of that type on auction as elements.

        values will be a dict of the item types as keys and the type value if wincondition == 0. Else value == None.

        rd is the current round in 0 based indexing.

        itemsinauction is a list where at index "rd" the item in that round is being sold is displayed. Note that it will either be as long as the sum of all the number of the items (as in "artists") in which case the full auction order is pre-announced and known, or len(itemsinauction) == rd+1, in which case it only holds the past and current items, the next item to be auctioned is unknown.

        winnerarray is a list where at index "rd" the winner of the item sold in that round is displayed.

        winneramount is a list where at index "rd" the amount of money paid for the item sold in that round is displayed.

        example: I will now construct a sentence that would be correct if you substituted the outputs of the lists:
        In round 5 winnerarray[4] bought itemsinauction[4] for winneramount[4] pounds/dollars/money unit.

        mybidderid is your name: if you want to reference yourself use that.

        players is a list containing all the names of the current players.

        standings is a set of nested dictionaries (standings is a dictionary that for each person has another dictionary
        associated with them). standings[name][artist] will return how many paintings "artist" the player "name" currently has.
        standings[name]['money'] (remember quotes for string, important!) returns how much money the player "name" has left.

            standings[mybidderid] is the information about you.
            I.e., standings[mybidderid]['money'] is the budget you have left.

        winnerpays is an integer representing which bid the highest bidder pays. If 0, the highest bidder pays their own bid,
        but if 1, the highest bidder instead pays the second highest bid (and if 2 the third highest, ect....). Note though that if you win, you always pay at least 1 (even if the second-highest was 0).

        Don't change any of these values, or you might confuse your bot! Just use them to determine your bid.
        You can also access any of the object variables defined in the constructor (though again don't change these!), or declare your own to save state between determinebid calls if you so wish.

        determinebid should return your bid as an integer. Note that if it exceeds your current budget (standings[mybidderid]['money']), the auction server will simply set it to your current budget.

        Good luck!
